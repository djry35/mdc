A full stack web application for data collection on fish killings and pollution reports.

Below is the breakdown of each MVC component in its full:

FRONT-END UI:

The model component has two pages ('about' page might be added later): the admin and main submission page. The admin page is a projection of submitted forms, editable by the admin only. The submissions page can be accessed by staff to submit their reports digitally. 

The form has the following fields in 'index.html':

Category: Descriptive Data
	Reporter's First Name: string
	Reporter's Last Name: string
	Reporter's Staff Title: string
	Reporter's Address: string
	Reporter's Zipcode: int

	Time of Investigation: 'XX:XX[ap]m'
	Nearest Town: string
	County Location: string
	Location Detail: (varied)
	Legal Descriptors: (varied)
	Type of Waterbody: string
	Waterbody Name: string

	Agency: string
	First Name: string
	Last Name: string
	Phone: string (varied)
	Email: string (varied)
	Date: 'XX/XX/XXXX'




------------Database---------------

The database tables have been split between the tables specific to fish kills, and people involved. The people tables have their own mock database that have been generalized for use outside the fish kills subject. Tables have been created to keep track of various categories for the use of autocomplete fields as well as statistical purposes. 

NOTE: for the purposes of the database, 0 = false, 1 = true. This mainly applies to the bit value fields in the various tables. 

The following tables are associated with general people information:

ZZZPeople
	PID (PRIMARY KEY)
		Type: int
		NULLable: no
		A number to associate with each person for uniqueness.
	FName
		Type: varchar(50)
		NULLable: yes
		The person's first name.
	LName
		Type: varchar(50)
		NULLable: yes
		The person's last name.
