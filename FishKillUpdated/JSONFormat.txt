Below describes the format of the web form converted to JSON. 

Used to standardize communication between the front end and the web API. 

The JSON consists of a basic key-field setup, as shown below:

[
	{ "name":<field name>, "value":<field value> },
	{ "name":<field name>, "value":<field value> },
	...
]

The field names are described below (NOTE: NOT ALL WILL GUARANTEED TO BE PRESENT. SEE FIELD DETAILS):

rFirstName
	The reporter's first name. Reporter is referring to the person accessing the site and filling out the form.
rLastName
	The reporter's last name.
rTitle
	The reporter's title at time of form entry.
rAddress
	The reporter's address at time of form entry.
rCity
	The city the reporter is living in. 
rZipCode
	The zip code the reporter is living in.
rPhone
	The reporter's current phone number. 

investigationDate
	The date the investigation took place.
investigationTime
	The time the investigation took place.
nearestTown
	The nearest town relative to the investigation site.
county
	The county the investigation took place in.
coordCategory
	Denotes the method of describing location specifics. See the UTM fields below. This value will either be "point" or "line"; if "point", use the starting values below. If "line", use starting and ending. 
startingUTM_X
	The starting point's X value to mark a specific location. Used in conjunction with the coordCategory and the below UTM values.
startingUTM_Y
	The starting point's Y value to mark a specific location. Used in conjunction with the coordCategory and the other UTM values. This combined with the starting X value marks a specific location where the investigation took place.
	startingUTM_X and startingUTM_Y will always be used if coordCategory is set. 
endingUTM_X
	The ending point's X value in marking a specific location. Used in conjunction with the other UTM values.
endingUTM_Y
	The ending point's Y value in marking a specific location. This combined with the ending X value helps mark a specific location for the investigation: (startX, startY) and (endX, endY) make a line to denote the coverage of the investigation. 
	NOTE: endingUTM_X and endingUTM_Y are not used if coordCategory is "point".  
legalTN
	The township value in TN/RW/S. Used for more identification of the investigation location. This is not required, although if specified, usually the RW and S values will be specified also. 
legalRW
	The range value in TN/RW/S. See legalTN. 
legalS
	The section value in TN/RW/S. See legalTN.
waterType
	The type of waterbody involved. Values are "lake", "pond", "stream", "wetland", "backwater" or "none".
waterbodyName
	The name of the waterbody. If waterType is "none", this is not specified.

(The following are repeated for multiple people notified. Each field will be suffixed by a number to denote the different people who are notified. Fields with the same suffixed number are referring to the same person.)
agencyNotified
	The agency the person belongs to at time of notification. 
personNotifiedFName
	The first name of the person notified. An individual might be omitted from the form, and instead only an agency is specified. These fields will still be present in the JSON, but blank. 
personNotifiedLName
	The last name of the person notified.
phoneNotified
	The phone number of the person or agency notified.
emailNotified
	The email of the person notified.
dateNotified
	The date the person/agency was notified.
timeNotified
	The time the person/agency was notified.

pollutionCategory
	The category the pollution source falls under. If multiple categories are specified, the pollutionCategory key will be used multiple times with different fields:
		{ "name":"pollutionCategory", "value": "agOps" },
		{ "name":"pollutionCategory", "value": "indOps" },
	etc. The possible values for pollutionCategory are "agOps", "indOps", "munOps", "transOps", "natural", "other", "unknown", and "none". This also does not have to be specified at all. If this is not specified, none of the related fields below or this field will be present.  
agOpsSubcategory
	If "agOps" is specified for pollutionCategory, a value for this field is possible, although not required. Similar to pollutionCategory, multiple subcategories can be specified which would put same key, multiple fields into the JSON the same way pollutionCategory will behave with multiple fields.
	The values for this field are "fertilizer", "pesticide", "manure" and other". 
indOpsSubcategory
	Identical behavior to agOpsSubcategory. Values for this field are "chemical", "petroleum", "metals" and other". 
munOpsSubcategory
	Identical behavior to agOpsSubcategory. Values for this field are "power", "refuse", "sewage" and other". 
transOpsSubcategory
	Identical behavior to agOpsSubcategory. Values for this field are "pipeline", "truck", "rail" and other". 
agOtherSpec
	If "other" is specified for agOpsSubcategory, this field is likely to be filled in. This field is always present in the JSON, but only has to be checked if "other" has been specified, since it will be guaranteed blank at all other times. 
indOtherSpec
	Identical behavior to agOtherSpec.
munOtherSpec
	Identical behavior to agOtherSpec.
transOtherSpec
	Identical behavior to agOtherSpec.

causePol
	The specific name of the pollutant to trigger the fish killing. Always present in the JSON, but could be ommited from the form. 
sourcePol
	The source of the above pollutant. Identical behavior to causePol.
quantityPol
	The amount of pollutant observed. The field could have units included with the value in the string; they are still combined into a string in the database, so no parsing needed. Identical behavior to causePol.
eventDatePol
	The date the pollutant started affecting the area. Identical behavior to causePol. 
moWatersContamination
	A "Yes"/"No"/"Unknown" value to denote missouri waters being contaminated. If not specified in the form, the field will not show up in the JSON.
groundwaterContamination
	Identical behavior to moWatersContamination. Value to denote groundwater being contaminated. 
otherDead
	Denotes if other animals were found dead. If specified, the value will be "on". Otherwise, it will not be in the JSON.
fishNaturallyDead
	Denotes if fish died of natural causes. Identical behavior to otherDead.
naturalDeadCt
	The estimated number of fish dead from natural causes. This will always be present in the JSON, but the value only has to be checked if fishNaturallyDead is specified.
speciesCategory
	Identical behavior to pollutionCategory. Values will vary as the form is edited at a later date. 
otherSpeciesDeadSpec
	Similar to the above OtherSpec fields, this will always be present in the JSON, but only has to be checked if speciesCategory has a value of "other". 
stateOfDecay
	WYSIWYG. Values possible are "Fresh", "Slight", and "Heavy". 
liveFishPresent
	Identical behavior to otherDead. Denotes if live fish are present at the site. 
injuriesObserved
	Identical behavior to otherDead. Denotes if injuries were observed or not. Specific injuries are below. 
injuryCategory
	Identical behavior to speciesCategory.
injuryOtherSpec
	Identical behavior to otherSpeciesDeadSpec.
behaviorCategory
	Identical behavior to speciesCategory.
otherBehaviorSpec
	Identical behavior to otherSpeciesDeadSpec.
dmgEval
	Denotes the numerical value of the damage observed. Always present in the JSON, but might have no value. 
dmgUnits
	The units associated with dmgEval. Values are "miles", "acres" and "feet". 
durationEffects
	Denotes number of days the damage has been taking place.
